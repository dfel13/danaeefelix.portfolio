          <div class="body-text">This is a current map of all the counties in the state of California. The map is overlapped with where the Patwin tribe territory used to be located. The purpose of this map's creation was to provide additional substancer to the land acknowledgement my team had created for our community partner, the Center for Child and Family Studies (CCFS). The requested that my team redesign the site while taking decolonization into account, thus it was important to implement this map in our land acknowledgement for the site.</div>
          <div class="body-text">This map was created via QGIS. The red point that locates the Center for Child and Family Studies was from the coordinates of a picture of the site taken during one of my team's site visits. Such coordinates were placed into Google Earth Pro which was then pinned. The pin for the site was then exported as an svg file to QGIS. I was able to change the pin to a red dot via Symbology. Additionally, I played around with the color contrast of the Patwin territory and the current California counties through Symbology; both feature classes were created with categorized symbols. Finally, an inset map of the UC Davis Campus map was applied to provide the audience a zoomed in view of where the CCFS is located on the college campus.</div>
