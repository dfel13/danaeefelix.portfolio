This was the most interesting aspect of the project for me as I was unaware that the state had volcanoes, let alone active volcanoes. When looking at the Contents pane on the left side of the image, the size of a red triangle is the number of active volcanoes located in a specific area.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Safe to say that the location of these active volcanoes are not very close to the major cities in Oregon. another interesting thing about this analysis is that these active volcanoes are located in areas where the median ages are higgher, whereas the areas of lower median ages are where the major cities are, thus, from a statistic standpoint, younger people live further away from the volcanoes.</div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
