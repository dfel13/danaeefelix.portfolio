With so many built roads and highways comes the consequences of wild animals being blocked from reaching their destinations. This project focused on finding solutions to this problem. I built a weighted suitability model to assist with designing three advanced/alternate corridors for California’s mountain lions. Variables considered were rugged terrain, precipitation, dense land cover, protected areas, and distance from roads. 
If this project were actually to pan out and there was a low budget forcing a priority on one corridor, the Los Padres to San Gabriel corridor should be prioritized. The corridor only has one road, with one side of the road showing land with human development and the opposite side of the road showing rugged terrain, untouched land by humans. This corridor would be ideal for conserving as it is easier to conserve and much help to the mountain lions.</div>
